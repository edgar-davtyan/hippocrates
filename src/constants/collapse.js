      "A peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of your stomach or your duodenum, the first part of your small intestine. Peptic ulcers happen when the acids that help you digest food damage the walls of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause is infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Another cause is the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Stress and spicy foods do not cause ulcers, but can make them worse. Symptoms: chest pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, abdominal bloating, burping, poor appetite, weight loss, bloody stool, dark stool, tarry stool, heartburn, hunger pains.",
